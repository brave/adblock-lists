# Lists

Brave heavily uses the community-maintained [EasyList](https://easylist.to/), [EasyPrivacy](https://github.com/easylist/easylist/tree/master/easyprivacy) and [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets) filter lists by default to block ads and trackers. This repo collects additional filter lists. You can see which lists are used and enabled by default in the [list catalog](https://github.com/brave/adblock-resources/blob/master/filter_lists/list_catalog.json). 

If you modify any of these lists, follow [these instructions](https://github.com/brave/ad-block/wiki/Testing-ad-block-rule-changes-in-Brave) to test your changes locally.

## Testing
